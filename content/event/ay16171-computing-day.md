NUS Students' Computing Club presents Computing Day 2016, a one day event to celebrate our presence in the Computing World as one School of Computing (SoC) family.

We would like to extend a warm welcome to anyone who is keen to know more about Computing in NUS, with technology-related booths to fun-filled games, everyone can definitely find something that would catch their interests.

So what are you waiting for? Take this opportunity to relax and join us in an exciting adventure of modernity!
