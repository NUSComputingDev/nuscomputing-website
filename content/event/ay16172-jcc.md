In an effort to assist smooth transition from the basic programming modules to CS1020 and CS2020, Computing Club will be conducting a Java Confidence Course (JCC) this January:

- Location: Programming Lab 1, 2, 3, 4
- Date: 7 January 2017, Saturday
- Time: 1000-1300, 1430-1730

Here’s a snippet of what you can expect from JCC: 
- Recap of procedural programming (from CS1010 or equivalent)
- Introduction to Java syntax/API
- Introduction to abstract data-types and object oriented programming, OOP (extremely important in data structure modules eg. CS1020 and CS2020)

The holidays are coming to an end – it’s time to tighten up those loose screws. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to brush up on your programming skills! What are you waiting for, gather your gears and everything on! Sign up now @ [tiny.cc/jcc](http://tiny.cc/jcc)
