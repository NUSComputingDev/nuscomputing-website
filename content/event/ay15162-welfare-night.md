Feeling the blues after a great vacation? Dread coming back to school?

Stay back this Friday night from 7.00pm onwards for Welfare Night! We have consoles set up for you in our Student Lounge, Steam games such as DOTA 2, L4D2, Team Fortress 2 ready to play in Programming Lab 6, board games and carom boards free to loan, and karaoke sessions too!

All these plus complementary snacks and drinks for your enjoyment! What are you waiting for? Grab your friends and have some fun before this hectic semester begins! Hope to see you there!
