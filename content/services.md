### Academic Advisory

The Academic Liaison is part of the NUS Studentsâ€™ Computing Club. Feel free to email us at acad{at}nuscomputing{dot}com any academics-related questions or feedback and we will try our very best to assist you! Visit our [website](http://acad.nuscomputing.com/) for more information!

### Lockers

At the start of the academic year, the NUS Students' Computing Club offers one free locker within COM1 for each School of Computing undergraduate. Undergraduates may register for a locker upon receiving an email from our Logistics department. There are no charges or fees for allocated lockers, so stay tuned!

### Loan Catalogue

In addition to lockers, you may also borrow other items from us! All you need to do is to come down to our club room at COM1 02-14 to register your name and collect your item(s).
