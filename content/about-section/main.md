The NUS Studentsâ€™ Computing Club, commonly known as CompClub, is a constituent club under NUS Students' Union (NUSSU). It represents all the undergraduates in NUS School of Computing and works together with different organisations to cater to the members' different needs and wants. CompClub strives to be the bridge between its members and the staff in the School of Computing, facilitating new initiatives by the school and channeling the feedback from its members to the right office.

Members can share their feedback to us by sending it to connect@nuscomputing.com or message us on our [Facebook page](fb.com/nuscomputing).
